# BioBenchmarks 
Speed comparison of several programming languages handling various biological computational tasks. A clear (debatable) benchmark of the computational expense of a specific tasks vs. the programmatic ease of developing a task, may yield a formula for determining the most time effective langauge to use during development.


## Languages

- C
- Java (10)
- Julia (1.0)
- Python (3.6)
- NodeJS (8.11)
- PHP (7.2)
- Perl (5.24)


## Installation
To run the benchmarks included in this repo, you must be able to install builds of the languages and versions listed above.


## Planned Comparisons

- **Reverse Compliment** - Time to run 10 million iterations of reverse compliments on a 100 base pair sequence.
- **Smith-Waterman Alignment** - Time to run 1 million alignments of 200 base pair sequence.
